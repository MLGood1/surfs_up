# Surfs_Up

## OVERVIEW

I want to live in Hawaii permanently so I decided to invest in the Surf -N Shake, a shop that will serve surf boards and ice cream to locals and tourist. I reached out to a potential investor, W. Avy, to see if he would be interested in investing in Surf -n Shake.  He has previously invested in a similar endeavor in a similar location and is concerned about weather conditions. He wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu to determine if a surf and ice cream shop is sustainable year-round.

### RESULTS

Three key differences in temperatures between June and December.

•	The average temperature is about three degrees higher in June than in December.

•	There is an 8º difference between the lowest temperature recorded in June and December.

•	50% of the temperatures for the month of June are below 75º, while 50% of the temperatures for December are below 71º.

### SUMMARY

In summary, there is not really a big difference in the temperatures in Oahu between the months of June and December. Some other analysis that could be performed to get a better understanding of if this shop would be sustainable throughout the year would be to consider looking at data for wind direction and tides, both of which determine wave formation, thereby surf conditions.
